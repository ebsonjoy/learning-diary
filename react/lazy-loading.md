# 📘 React - Lazy Loading

## 🔍 What is Lazy Loading?

Lazy Loading is a design pattern that delays the loading of components or data until it's needed.

🧠 Purpose:
✔️ Improve performance
✔️ Reduce initial load time
✔️ Split code into smaller chunks (Code-Splitting)

## 📦 Default Behavior:
👉 All components are bundled and loaded together (big file)
❌ Bad for performance in large apps

## ✅ Solution: React.lazy + Suspense

👉 React provides built-in functions for lazy loading:
- React.lazy()
- Suspense 

## 🧱 What is Suspense in React?

Suspense is a **React component** used to wrap **lazy-loaded components** and handle their **loading state**.

📦 Purpose:
- To show a fallback UI (like a loader) while a lazy component is being fetched.
- It tells React: “While this component is loading, show something else.”

## 📁 Example: Lazy Load a Component

```js

🗂️ File Structure:
- App.js
- About.js

// ✅ About.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}

// ✅ App.js
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

const About = lazy(() => import("./About"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <About />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

```
## 🛠️ Real-life Example:

- 🖼️ Lazy load images on scroll
- 🧭 Lazy load routes (pages)
- 📦 Lazy load components in large apps


## 🎯 Advantages of Lazy Loading:

- ✔ Faster initial page load
- ✔ Loads only what's needed
- ✔ Less memory usage
- ✔ Good for large-scale applications


## ⚠️ Disadvantages:

❗ Slight delay when loading components
❗ Need fallback UI (loading spinner, etc.)
❗ React.lazy only supports default exports


## 🧠 Summary:

✅ React.lazy(() => import())
✅ Wrap lazy component with <Suspense />
✅ Use with routes, components, images, etc.
✅ Great for performance optimization
