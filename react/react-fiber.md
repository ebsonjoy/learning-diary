# React Fiber

## What is React Fiber?

**React Fiber** is the **new core algorithm** of React (since React 16).

It’s a **complete rewrite** of the old React reconciliation engine, which is responsible for **updating the DOM**.

> React Fiber helps React apps be **faster**, **more responsive**, and handle **complex UI updates** better.

---

## Why was React Fiber introduced?

The old algorithm had limitations:
- Couldn't pause, stop, or restart work in the middle.
- Was not great for animations or large updates.
- All updates were done in a single go (synchronous), which could block the browser.

React Fiber fixed this by:
✅ Making updates **interruptible**  
✅ Allowing **prioritization** of updates  
✅ Supporting **better error handling** and **concurrent rendering**

## Key Features of React Fiber

1. **Incremental rendering** – Work can be split into chunks and paused/resumed.
2. **Prioritization** – High-priority updates (like typing) are handled first.
3. **Concurrency** – Enables **Concurrent Mode**, improving UI responsiveness.
4. **Backwards compatibility** – Old code still works with the Fiber architecture.

## Simple Analogy

Imagine React is painting a huge wall (UI update):

- 🧱 **Old React**: Tries to paint the whole wall without stopping. If interrupted, must start over.
- 🖌️ **React Fiber**: Paints a small part, checks if something urgent came up, and continues only when ready. Smarter and smoother.

## Internal Concepts (Just for Awareness)

| Term           | Meaning                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Fiber Node     | A unit of work (represents a React element)    |
| Reconciliation | Finding the difference between old & new UI    |
| Work Loop      | The process that schedules and processes fiber |
| lanes          | Used to assign priorities to updates           |

---

## Do I Need to Learn It Deeply?

No, not unless you are:
- Building React internals
- Using Concurrent Mode
- Working on performance optimization

For regular developers, just knowing that **Fiber makes React faster and smarter** is enough.

## Summary

| Feature                  | Old React           | React Fiber        |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Interruptible rendering  | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes              |
| Prioritized updates      | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes              |
| Supports concurrency     | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes              |
| Better error handling    | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes              |

> React Fiber = React’s brain that helps update the UI smarter, smoother, and faster!
