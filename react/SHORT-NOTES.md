# 1.Cleanup Function in React

## What is it?
A cleanup function is returned inside `useEffect` to clean up side effects when the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs.

## Where is it used?
- Inside `useEffect`
- To stop timers
- To remove event listeners
- To cancel async tasks

## Syntax
```js
useEffect(() => {
  // effect code

  return () => {
    // cleanup code
  };
}, []);
```

## Example
```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Tick');
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
      console.log('Cleanup');
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>Timer running...</div>;
}
```

# 2.Prevent Prop Drilling in React

## What is it?
Prop drilling happens when you pass data through many nested components, even if only the deepest one needs it.

## Problem
Too many props passed down ‚Üí hard to manage, cluttered code.

## How to Prevent It?

### 1. Context API
Use it to share data without passing props manually.

```js
// context.js
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';
export const UserContext = createContext();

// App.js
<UserContext.Provider value={{ name: 'Ebson' }}>
  <Parent />
</UserContext.Provider>

// Any child
const { name } = useContext(UserContext);
```

### 2. Redux / State Management
Use Redux, Zustand, or other global state libraries to manage and access state.

### 3. Component Composition
Pass components as children or props instead of data.

```js
function Wrapper({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

<Wrapper>
  <ComponentNeedingData />
</Wrapper>
```

# 3.Higher Order Component (HOC) in React

## What is it?  
A Higher Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component.

## Why use it?  
To reuse logic and add extra functionality to components without repeating code.

## Syntax  
```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```

## Example  
```js
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function(props) {
    console.log('Rendering:', WrappedComponent.name);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  }
}

// Usage
const Button = (props) => <button {...props}>Click me</button>;
const ButtonWithLogger = withLogger(Button);
```

In this example, `withLogger` adds a console log whenever the component renders.

---

# 4.Conditional Rendering in React

## What is it?  
Showing or hiding UI elements based on conditions.

## How to use it?

### 1. Using `if` statement  
```js
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Please sign in.</h1>;
}
```

### 2. Using Ternary Operator  
```js
<div>{isLoggedIn ? <UserProfile /> : <LoginButton />}</div>
```

### 3. Using Logical AND (`&&`)  
```js
{isLoggedIn && <LogoutButton />}
```

## Why use?  
To display different UI based on app state or props.

---

# 5.Render Props in React

## What is it?  
A **render prop** is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render. It lets you share code between components by passing a function that returns React elements.

## Why use it?  
To reuse logic in different ways without repeating code or using inheritance.

## Simple Example  
```js
function MouseTracker({ render }) {
  const [position, setPosition] = React.useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  function handleMouseMove(e) {
    setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
  }

  return (
    <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove} style={{ height: '100px', border: '1px solid black' }}>
      {render(position)}
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage:
<MouseTracker render={({ x, y }) => (
  <p>Mouse position: {x}, {y}</p>
)} />
```

- `MouseTracker` tracks mouse position.
- It calls `render` function with current position to decide what to show.

# 6.Synthetic Events in React

## What is it?  
Synthetic events are React‚Äôs cross-browser wrapper around the native browser events. They provide a consistent interface for events in React apps.

## Why use it?  
To handle events the same way in all browsers.

## Example  
```js
function ClickButton() {
  function handleClick(event) {
    console.log('Button clicked', event.type);
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

- React‚Äôs event object is called a SyntheticEvent.
- It works like the native event but is consistent across browsers.
- Synthetic events are pooled for performance (reused internally).

---

# 7.Rules of Hooks

## What are Hooks?
Hooks are functions that let you **use state and other React features** in functional components.

## Rules of Hooks

### 1. **Only call Hooks at the top level**
- Do **not** call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Always call them at the **top level** of your component.

‚úÖ Correct:
```js
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
}
```

---

# 8.React.StrictMode

## What is it?
`React.StrictMode` is a **tool provided by React to help developers write better code**.  
It **does not show any UI** ‚Äî it's only used in **development mode** (not in production).

## What does it do?
It helps you find and fix:
- **Unsafe or outdated lifecycle methods**
- **Side effects** that happen during rendering
- **Incorrect usage of hooks**
- **Deprecated APIs**

It makes React **stricter in development** to catch bugs early.

## How does it work?
- It **intentionally runs components twice** (only in development) to check for side effects.
- It shows **warnings** in the browser console if it finds any issues.

## Where is it used?
You wrap your app or part of it in `<React.StrictMode>` in the root file:

### Example:
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

```

# 9.Why Arrays and Objects Are Copied When Updating State in React

**What:**  
In React, we should **not directly change** (mutate) arrays or objects in state.  
Instead, we create a **copy**, make changes to that, and then update the state.

---

**Why is this important?**

React decides whether to re-render a component by checking if the state or props have **changed**.  
But it checks this by comparing the **reference** (memory address), not the actual content.

If you **mutate** the original object/array:
- The reference stays the same.
- React thinks nothing changed.
- So, the component **won‚Äôt re-render**.

---

**Solution: Make a new copy!**  
This gives React a **new reference**, so it can detect the change and re-render correctly.

---

**Example (Array):**
```js
// Wrong way - mutates original array
users.push('Ebson'); 
setUsers(users); // ‚ùå React may not re-render

// Correct way - creates a new array
setUsers([...users, 'Ebson']); // ‚úÖ React re-renders
```

# 10. Event Pooling

### what is Event Pooling

üß† Simple Explanation:
In older versions of React (before version 17), when you click a button or type in an input, React creates an event object and sends it to your function.
But to save memory, React reused the same event object for all future events ‚Äî this is called event pooling.

So, if you used the event inside a setTimeout or an async call, the event would be cleared before your code ran.
That means you could not access e.target, e.type, etc. anymore.

**What:**  
In older React versions (before 17), React reused event objects to save memory.  
This is called **event pooling**.

**Problem:**  
The event object was **cleared** after the event handler finished.  
So if you used it later (like in `setTimeout`), it would not work.

**Example (React < 17):**
```js
function handleClick(e) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(e.target); // ‚ùå Won‚Äôt work
  }, 1000);
}


// ‚úÖ Fix using e.persist():
function handleClick(e) {
  e.persist(); // Keeps the event object alive
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(e.target); // ‚úÖ Now it works
  }, 1000);
}
```
**‚úÖ In React 17+:**
You don‚Äôt need e.persist() anymore because event pooling is removed.
You can safely use e.target inside setTimeout, async functions, etc.
